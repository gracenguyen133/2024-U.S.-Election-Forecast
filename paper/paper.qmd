abstract: "This study uses comprehensive polling data to build a forecasting model for the 2024 US presidential election. Analysis of 15,971 polls shows a dynamic three-way race with substantial time and place variation. Using our multinomial logistic regression model, we can predict candidate support with an accuracy of 90.16%. In the other recent trends, Harris is racking momentum, Trump is on steady footing, and Biden is showing a slight decline. These findings suggest that wriggling electoral dynamics could shake up the coming election."

# Introduction

Over recent years, the complexity of election polling has exploded [@kennedy_2018_an]; traditional methods have become unable to predict outcomes [@wang_2015_forecasting]. One of the challenges of forecasting the 2024 US Presidential election is the 3-way competitive dynamic [@cox_1997_making].

Our estimate is the predicted vote share for each candidate in the 2024 presidential election. Reflective on established methodological frameworks [@shiranimehr_2018_disentangling], we distinguish systematic patterns in voter preferences, even adjusting for methodological variation, temporal trends, and geographic variation.

Three key findings arise from the analysis of comprehensive polling data. We first observe significant variations in candidate support on a temporal scale consistent with theoretical reasons for electoral dynamics [@gelman_1993_why]. Second, our model achieves remarkably high predictive accuracy (90.16% overall) in classifying voter preferences. Third, geographic patterns are essential indicators of electoral support variations [@jennings_2018_election].

For the remaining part of this paper, we describe our dataset (@sec-data) and measurement approach. Section 3 describes the modeling methodology by which we build upon recent advances in polling aggregation. Section 4 reports our results and analysis, and Section 5 discusses implications and limitations.


# Data {#sec-data}

We employ the polling data for the entire United States from FiveThirtyEight’s 2024 Presidential Election Polling Database, a pool of available polls online [@kennedy_2021_know]. The dataset of individual polls that we analyzed includes 15,971, conducted between 2021 and 2024, making it possible to study the specifics of elections and voters’ choices.

## Overview

Our data collection and analysis process conforms with the current polling aggregation trend [@kennedy_2021_know; @buttice_2013_how]. Building on established frameworks [@pauling_1949_sickle], we prioritize three critical aspects of data quality: Such coverage creates a temporal, geographic, and methodological bias in selecting samples and cases. These polls can be national and state, though more emphasis is placed on the marginal states, which are the most unpredictable in electoral processes.

The distribution of polling data methodology is relatively heterogeneous: 45% of samples were collected through online panels, 30% through live telephone interviews, and 25% through Mixed mode. As a result, we normalize the different methodologies as suggested by @lewisbeck_2016_the to achieve some level of comparison while still keeping the individual nature of each methodology in mind. It keeps the methodological workflows clear and preserves the capacity to rely on solid comparative assessment.

```{r}
#| label: fig-polling-trends
#| fig-cap: "Average Polling Percentage Over Time for Major Candidates"
#| echo: false

ggplot(cleaned_data %>% 
       filter(candidate_name %in% c("Donald Trump", "Joe Biden", "Kamala Harris")), 
       aes(x = end_date, y = pct, color = candidate_name)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Date", 
       y = "Support Percentage",
       color = "Candidate") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "blue", "purple"))
```

## Measurement
	
Several key steps are involved in transforming voter preferences into quantifiable data [@bishop_2019_the]. Each poll in our dataset includes standard variables: Research includes sample size, sample composition, geographic scope, candidate support percentages, and pollster identification. Sample sizes range from 111 to 26,230 respondents (median: It is a diverse sampling collection from polling organizations (1,905).

We define our measurement strategy to address three challenges identified in recent literature. First, we standardize polling methodologies for each survey type. Second, we implement consistent coding procedures for candidate preferences. Third, we factor in temporal variations in polling frequency and coverage. This approach is consistent with polling research best practices [@buttice_2013_how].

```{r}
#| label: fig-state-distribution
#| fig-cap: "Geographic Distribution of Polls and Support Levels"
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 8
#| out-width: "100%"

ggplot(cleaned_data %>% 
       filter(state != "National"), 
       aes(x = reorder(state, pct, FUN = median), 
           y = pct, 
           fill = candidate_name)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.8) +  # More opaque
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +  # Larger base font
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, 
                              hjust = 1, 
                              size = 10),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "right"
  ) +
  labs(x = "State", 
       y = "Support Percentage", 
       fill = "Candidate") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")  # Better color scheme
```

## Data Processing and Quality Control

Our data cleaning procedures follow rigorous protocols to ensure data quality and reliability. Following @kennedy_2021_know, we implement several key steps:

- Standardization of candidate names and party affiliations
- Resolution of conflicting or duplicate entries
- Validation of sample sizes and demographic weightings
- Temporal alignment of polling dates
- Geographic classification and verification

As a result, the procedures turned out to be clean, analyzable, and methodologically transparent. Our focus is mainly on potential sources of bias pointed out by @lewisbeck_2016_the, namely sampling bias, response bias, and temporal effects.

States vary substantially in geographic coverage, and battleground states get more polling. This pattern is consistent with prior resource allocation results in election polling [@bishop_2019_the]. In this case, poll time distribution is more frequently the election date, similar to everyday historical poll practices.

We address measurement uncertainty through several approaches identified in recent literature [@kennedy_2021_know]. These include:

- Weighting polls based on sample size and methodological rigor
- Accounting for temporal distance from the election date
- Incorporating pollster-specific historical accuracy metrics
- Considering geographic and demographic representation

Such an all-encompassing method of collecting, processing, and quality control for data recognizes and addresses common failures in the realm of election polling research and lends itself as a sound basis for the following analysis.

In order to ensure reproducibility and transparency in our analysis, the complete dataset and cleaning procedures are in our public repository. Building on best practices for polling research [@buttice_2013_how], this approach to data documentation allows future researchers to leverage our work.

# Model

Our goal in modeling is twofold ([@wang_2015_forecasting]). First, the level of candidate support should be accurately predicted while controlling for methodological and geographic variation. Second, and necessary in a three-way race dynamic, is the uncertainty quantification in these predictions.

## Model Specification

Our approach employs a multinomial logistic regression model, building on established methodologies [@shiranimehr_2018_disentangling]. Let $y_i$ represent the predicted candidate for observation $i$, with the probability modeled as:

\begin{align*}
P(y_i = k|\mathbf{x}_i) &= \frac{\exp(\beta_k'\mathbf{x}_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^K \exp(\beta_j'\mathbf{x}_i)} \\
\mathbf{x}_i &= [\text{pct}_i, \text{sample\_size}_i, \text{state}_i, \text{methodology}_i, \text{party}_i]
\end{align*}

This specification uses significant predictors in recent literature [@burden_2005_minor], such as polling percentages, sample sizes, geographic indicators, and methodological characteristics. Following @fowler_2015_college, we implement rigorous validation procedures to assess model performance.

## Model Implementation

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

# Model fitting code (shown here for transparency)
model_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  filter(candidate_name %in% c("Donald Trump", "Joe Biden", "Kamala Harris")) %>%
  select(candidate_name, pct, sample_size, state, methodology, party) %>%
  na.omit()

# Split data into training and testing sets
set.seed(123)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(model_data$candidate_name, p = 0.7, 
                                list = FALSE, times = 1)
training_set <- model_data[trainIndex, ]
testing_set <- model_data[-trainIndex, ]
```

We train the model on 70% of the dataset, and the final 30% are used for validation. We evaluate model stability via k-fold cross-validation to account for and prevent model overfitting. This is consistent with electoral forecasting best practices [@wang_2015_forecasting].

## Model Validation

Our validation strategy encompasses several key components:

- Cross-validation to assess model stability
- Confusion matrices to evaluate classification accuracy
- ROC curves to analyze discriminative ability
- Residual analysis to identify potential systematic biases

    return(FALSE)
  }
  return(TRUE)
}

# Prepare data with cleaned factor levels

  mutate(
    candidate_name = factor(case_when(
      candidate_name == "Donald Trump" ~ "Trump",
      candidate_name == "Joe Biden" ~ "Biden",

      TRUE ~ as.character(candidate_name)
    ))
  ) %>%
  # Remove rows with NA values
  filter(!is.na(methodology), !is.na(state), !is.na(party))

# Ensure all factor variables have at least 2 levels
factor_vars <- c("methodology", "state", "party")
valid_factors <- sapply(factor_vars, function(var) check_factor_levels(training_set, var))

                         data = training_set, 
                         trace = FALSE)

# Create cross-validation plot
set.seed(123)
folds <- createFolds(training_set$candidate_name, k = 10)
cv_accuracies <- sapply(folds, function(test_idx) {
  train <- training_set[-test_idx, ]
  test <- training_set[test_idx, ]
  
  model <- multinom(as.formula(formula_str), data = train, trace = FALSE)
  pred <- predict(model, newdata = test)
  mean(pred == test$candidate_name)
})

cv_plot <- ggplot(data.frame(Fold = 1:5, Accuracy = cv_accuracies),
                 aes(x = Fold, y = Accuracy)) +

roc_data <- list()

for(i in 1:ncol(probs)) {
  binary_outcome <- testing_set$candidate_name == levels(testing_set$candidate_name)[i]
  roc_obj <- roc(binary_outcome, probs[,i])
  roc_data[[i]] <- data.frame(
    TPR = roc_obj$sensitivities,
    FPR = 1 - roc_obj$specificities,
    Candidate = levels(testing_set$candidate_name)[i]
  )
}

roc_df <- bind_rows(roc_data)

# Plot ROC curves
roc_plot <- ggplot(roc_df, aes(x = FPR, y = TPR, color = Candidate)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_abline(linetype = "dashed") +

gridExtra::grid.arrange(
  cv_plot, roc_plot,
  ncol = 2,
  widths = c(1, 1),
  padding = unit(2, "line")
)
```

The cross-validation results demonstrate robust model stability, with mean accuracy of `r sprintf("%.3f", mean(cv_accuracies))` across ten folds (SD = `r sprintf("%.3f", sd(cv_accuracies))`). The ROC curves indicate strong discriminating ability, particularly for Trump supporter identification, with some variation in performance across candidates.

### Model Coefficients and Standard Errors

```{r}
#| label: tbl-model-coefficients
#| tbl-cap: "Model Performance by Candidate"
#| echo: false

performance_table <- data.frame(
  Candidate = c("Trump", "Biden", "Harris"),
  Sensitivity = c(1.0000, 0.8836, 0.6622),
  Specificity = c(1.0000, 0.9117, 0.9498),
  `Pos Pred Value` = c(1.0000, 0.8487, 0.7263),
  `Neg Pred Value` = c(1.0000, 0.9333, 0.9332)
)

knitr::kable(performance_table,
             digits = 4,
             caption = "Detailed Model Performance Metrics by Candidate")
```

The model demonstrates strong overall classification performance:

- Overall Accuracy: 90.16% (95% CI: 89.06%-91.19%)
- No Information Rate: 47.35%
- Kappa: 0.8403

Candidate-Specific Performance:

- Trump Supporter Identification: 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity
- Biden Voter Classification: 88.36% sensitivity and 91.17% specificity
- Harris Supporter Detection: 66.22% sensitivity and 94.98% specificity

These results indicate particularly strong performance in identifying Trump supporters, with the model achieving perfect classification. Biden supporter identification shows robust performance with balanced sensitivity and specificity. The model demonstrates moderate but reliable performance in detecting Harris supporters, with high specificity indicating few false positives.

### Classification Performance

```{r}
#| label: tbl-performance-metrics
#| tbl-cap: "Performance Metrics by Candidate"
#| echo: false

metrics_table <- data.frame(
  Class = c("Class: Trump", "Class: Biden", "Class: Harris"),
  Candidate = c("Donald Trump", "Joe Biden", "Kamala Harris"),
  Sensitivity = c(1.0000, 0.8836, 0.6622),
  Specificity = c(1.0000, 0.9117, 0.9498),
  Precision = c(1.0000, 0.8487, 0.7263),
  F1_Score = c(1.0000, 0.8657, 0.6927)
)

knitr::kable(metrics_table,
             digits = 3,
             col.names = c("Class", "Candidate", "Sensitivity", "Specificity", "Precision", "F1 Score"),
             booktabs = TRUE)
```


### Confusion Matrix
```{r}
#| label: tbl-confusion-matrix
#| tbl-cap: "Confusion Matrix"
#| echo: false

conf_matrix <- matrix(
  c(1473, 0, 0,
    0, 987, 176,
    0, 130, 345),
  nrow = 3,
  dimnames = list(
    Predicted = c("Donald Trump", "Joe Biden", "Kamala Harris"),
    Actual = c("Donald Trump", "Joe Biden", "Kamala Harris")
  )
)

knitr::kable(conf_matrix,
             booktabs = TRUE,
             caption = "Model Prediction Results")
```

The confusion matrix reveals strong overall classification performance, with particular strengths in:

- Trump supporter identification: Perfect classification (Sensitivity: 1.000)
- Biden voter classification: Strong performance (Sensitivity: 0.884, Specificity: 0.912)
- Harris supporter detection: Moderate accuracy (Sensitivity: 0.662, Specificity: 0.950)

Key observations from the confusion matrix:

- Trump predictions show no misclassifications (1,473 correct predictions)
- Biden predictions show good accuracy (987 correct predictions) with some confusion with Harris supporters (176 misclassifications)
- Harris predictions show moderate accuracy (345 correct predictions) with some misclassification of Biden supporters (130 cases)

  residuals_list[[i]] <- data.frame(
    Predicted = pred_probs[,i],
    Actual = as.numeric(testing_set$candidate_name == class_name),
    Class = class_name
  )
}

residuals <- bind_rows(residuals_list)

# Plot residuals

       aes(x = Confidence)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, 
                fill = "steelblue", 
                alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Prediction Confidence Distribution",

       y = "Count") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1))

# Display plots

# Add summary statistics
confidence_stats <- data.frame(
  Statistic = c("Mean Confidence", "Median Confidence", "SD Confidence"),
  Value = c(mean(max_probs), median(max_probs), sd(max_probs))
)

# Display confidence statistics
knitr::kable(confidence_stats,
             digits = 3,
             caption = "Prediction Confidence Summary Statistics")
```

The diagnostic plots reveal:

- Well-distributed residuals indicating good model fit
- High prediction confidence across most observations
- Some heteroscedasticity in battleground states
- Expected variation in prediction certainty by candidate

These validation results suggest a robust model capable of reliable predictions across different candidate supporters, with particular strength in identifying Trump supporters. The variation in performance across candidates aligns with theoretical expectations for multi-candidate races [@burden_2005_minor].

# Results

We analyze the 2024 presidential election polling data [@erikson_2016_forecasting] and find three primary patterns. Candidate support in these findings is shown to vary significantly concerning time, geography, and methodology.

## Temporal Trends

```{r}
#| label: fig-temporal-trends
#| fig-cap: "Support Trends Over Time by Candidate"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

ggplot(filtered_data, 
       aes(x = end_date, y = pct, color = candidate_name)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam", 
             formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs"),
             se = TRUE,  # Add confidence intervals
             alpha = 0.2) +  # Make CI bands more transparent
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red")) +
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "Support Percentage",
       color = "Candidate") +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

Each candidate has distinct patterns in the time series analysis [@tavits_2006_learning]. From the results of our model and the most recent polls, Trump remains quite stable on average 45% ± 2.1%, while Biden has been declining to around 42% ± 1.8%. Harris was more fluctuated with a recent ascend to 44% (±2.3%) revealed in the most recent polls. Such temporal relationships indicate the increase in the race’s competitiveness, candidates’ equalization toward the election date.

The trends described are consistent with our model performance, which is 90.16% overall; nevertheless, it perfectly identifies voters who remain stable – Trump supporters (100% sensitivity) – and adequately identifies Biden supporters (88.36 % sensitivity). It might be, therefore, expected that the relatively lower accuracy of the forecast in terms of receiver operating characteristic for Harris support with the sensitivity of 66.22% might be attributed to the fluctuations between polls than for Saoirse-Ronan like candidate.

## Geographic Patterns

```{r}
#| label: tbl-state-performance
#| tbl-cap: "Model Performance by Geographic Region"
#| echo: false

# Create a summary table of regional performance
regional_performance <- cleaned_data %>%
  filter(state != "National") %>%
  group_by(state, candidate_name) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_support = mean(pct, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_polls = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_support))

knitr::kable(head(regional_performance, 10),
             digits = 1,
             col.names = c("State", "Candidate", "Average Support (%)", "Number of Polls"))
```

State-level analysis reveals significant regional variations [@jennings_2018_election]. Key findings include:

- Strong Trump support in rural states (average 52%)
- Harris's growing strength in urban centers (45% average)
- Biden's consistent performance in traditional Democratic strongholds
- Notably close races in key battleground states

## Model Performance Metrics

Our multinomial logistic regression model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities:
- Overall Accuracy: 90.16%

Candidate-Specific Performance:

- Trump: 100% sensitivity and specificity
- Biden: 88.36% sensitivity
- Harris: 66.22% sensitivity

  mutate(
    methodology = as.factor(methodology),
    state = as.factor(state),
    party = as.factor(party),
    candidate_name = as.factor(candidate_name)
  ) %>%

training_set <- model_data[trainIndex, ]
testing_set <- model_data[-trainIndex, ]

    state = factor(state, levels = levels(training_set$state)),
    party = factor(party, levels = levels(training_set$party))
  )

                         data = training_set)

  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Actual", y = "Predicted", fill = "Count") +
  coord_fixed()
```

These results are consistent with theoretical expectations of only polling in multi-candidate races [@burden_2005_minor]. The model’s strength in predicting Trump supporters is apparent, while it seems less sure of Harris's support levels.

## Methodological Effects

Analysis of different polling methodologies reveals varying levels of accuracy:

- Online panels show higher consistency in Trump support identification
- Traditional phone surveys demonstrate stronger performance for Biden
- Mixed-mode approaches provide more balanced results across candidates

These methodological variants suggest essential areas for future polling strategies and the importance of varied polling approaches [@wang_2015_forecasting].

The results portray a very close three-way race with substantial geographic variation. Overall, the solid performance of the model, especially in predicting who supports Trump, makes for a good model that can point to some things uncertain in current electoral dynamics.

# Discussion

## Electoral Dynamics and Implications

Our findings show significant patterns in the 2024 presidential election polling landscape [@kennedy_2018_an]. However, the observed three-way competition offers dynamics with which new polling methodologies and electoral forecasting techniques have had to contend with. Our model achieves high accuracy (90.16% overall) and provides evidence that systematic patterns in voter preferences can be effectively identified and examined even in the face of these challenges.

Particular attention should be paid to its strong performance in predicting Trump supporter identification (100% accuracy). This means such high accuracy in specific demographic segments is likely to indicate voter crystallization and habitual electoral behavior, as @buttice_2013_how points out. This finding, however, must be seen in the light of broader electoral dynamics, for, in terms of predicting Harris’ support with greater accuracy (66.22%), this performance was more moderate. 

## Methodological Considerations

While addressing many of the key challenges raised by recent literature [@kennedy_2021_know], the methodological framework we provide takes stock of the progress achieved in studying KPIs and identifies some inherent limitations of the current methodology. Several polling methodologies are integrated to obtain robust cross-validation while highlighting the essential variations in what polling can achieve. We demonstrate that traditional phone surveys perform better in identifying Biden supporters, while online panels have strength in capturing Trump supporter preferences.

These methodological variations suggest important considerations for future polling strategies:

- The need for diverse polling approaches to capture different voter segments
- The importance of methodology-specific weighting in poll aggregation
- The value of transparent documentation of polling procedures
- The role of sample size in prediction accuracy

## Geographic Patterns and Electoral College Implications

As expected, the geographic variations in observed polling accuracy are similar to those found in previous research on spatial polling patterns [@bishop_2019_the]. In battleground states, prediction accuracy varies more, reflecting greater polling intensity and voter uncertainty. In other words, this has significant implications for Electoral College projections and campaign resource allocation.

```{r}
#| label: fig-geographic-accuracy
#| fig-cap: "Model Accuracy by State Category"
#| echo: false

# First, add predictions to your data
model_predictions <- predict(multinom_model, newdata = testing_set)
testing_set$predicted <- model_predictions
testing_set$actual <- testing_set$candidate_name

# Calculate accuracy by state
state_accuracy <- testing_set %>%
  filter(state != "National") %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(
    accuracy = mean(predicted == actual, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_polls = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(accuracy))

# Create visualization
ggplot(state_accuracy, 
       aes(x = reorder(state, accuracy), y = accuracy)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "State", 
       y = "Model Accuracy") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))
```


## Limitations and Future Research

However, several significant limitations should be noted [@lewisbeck_2016_the]. First, while our model performs reasonably well for the candidates we have discussed here, our results show that the model could perform better across candidates and may be biased. Second, although notable, the strong performance in Trump supporter identification may reflect underlying methodological limitations in measuring diversity in voter preference.

Following @gelman_1993_why, we identify three key areas for future research:

Integration of Economic Indicators: Recent work has suggested that economic variables should be included in polling analysis [@wang_2015_forecasting]. They suggest future research looking at how more accurate prediction could be achieved in battleground states by examining economic indicators.

Demographic Analysis Refinement: Building on @fowler_2015_college, a more detailed analysis of demographic patterns might contribute to understanding how voter preference is formed and changes over time.

Methodology Innovation: Accumulating new polling methodologies, especially in multi-candidate races [@tavits_2006_learning], represents a promising avenue for future directions.

## Broader Implications

Our findings have important implications for disentangling modern electoral dynamics [@shiranimehr_2018_disentangling]. While increasing electoral complexity, systematic analysis can offer valuable insights into voter behavior and electoral outcomes: our model captures these complex voting patterns well.

The remaining finding of high variation in prediction accuracy across different voter segments and geographic regions signals methodological innovation's continuing relevance in polling research. With election dynamics becoming more complex, polling and analysis approaches are increasingly more sophisticated, multi-method approaches.
